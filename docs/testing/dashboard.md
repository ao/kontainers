### Coverage Trends

- **Current Sprint**: +2% overall coverage improvement
- **Previous Sprint**: +3% overall coverage improvement
- **Target**: 85% overall coverage by next release

### Coverage Gaps

The following areas have lower test coverage and should be prioritized for improvement:

1. **WebSocket Communication**: 65% coverage
   - Real-time event handling needs more tests
   - Reconnection scenarios are under-tested

2. **Error Handling Edge Cases**: 70% coverage
   - Network failure scenarios need more tests
   - Concurrent error conditions need better coverage

3. **Complex UI Interactions**: 75% coverage
   - Multi-step workflows need more end-to-end tests
   - Modal interactions need more comprehensive testing

## Test Status

### Test Suite Health

| Test Type | Count | Pass Rate | Avg. Duration | Flakiness |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Unit Tests** | 425 | 99.8% | 0.12s | 0.2% |
| **Integration Tests** | 87 | 98.9% | 0.85s | 1.5% |
| **E2E Tests** | 32 | 97.5% | 3.2s | 3.8% |
| **Performance Tests** | 18 | 100% | 1.5s | 0.5% |

### Recent Test Failures

| Test | Failure Rate | Last Failed | Issue |
|------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| `ProxyRuleForm.test.tsx` | 2.5% | 2 days ago | #243: Intermittent timing issue |
| `ContainerService.integration.test.ts` | 1.8% | 5 days ago | #238: Race condition in container startup |
| `WebSocketConnection.test.ts` | 3.2% | 1 day ago | #251: Connection timeout in CI environment |

## CI/CD Integration

### Pipeline Status

| Pipeline | Status | Last Run | Duration |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Main Branch** | Passing | 12 hours ago | 4m 32s |
| **Development Branch** | Passing | 3 hours ago | 4m 18s |
| **PR Checks** | Passing | 1 hour ago | 3m 56s |

### Test Execution in CI

- **Frequency**: On every push and pull request
- **Parallelization**: Tests run in 4 parallel jobs
- **Caching**: Node modules and test results are cached
- **Artifacts**: Coverage reports and test results are stored as artifacts

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Performance Testing Environment**
   - Issue: Performance tests may produce inconsistent results in CI environment
   - Status: Under investigation
   - Workaround: Use local performance test results as the source of truth

2. **Test Data Management**
   - Issue: Test data setup is sometimes duplicated across test suites
   - Status: Planned for refactoring
   - Workaround: Use shared test data utilities where possible

3. **WebSocket Testing**
   - Issue: WebSocket tests occasionally time out in CI environment
   - Status: Being addressed in issue #251
   - Workaround: Increase timeout values and retry failed tests

4. **Visual Regression Testing**
   - Issue: No automated visual regression testing implemented yet
   - Status: Planned for next quarter
   - Workaround: Manual visual verification

## Future Improvements

### Short-term (Next Sprint)

1. **Improve Test Reliability**
   - Address flaky tests in WebSocket and container integration tests
   - Implement better test isolation for integration tests
   - Add retry mechanism for network-dependent tests

2. **Enhance Coverage Reporting**
   - Integrate coverage reports with PR comments
   - Add coverage trend visualization
   - Implement coverage gates for critical paths

3. **Optimize Test Performance**
   - Reduce test suite execution time by 20%
   - Implement more efficient test data setup
   - Improve parallelization of test execution

### Medium-term (Next Quarter)

1. **Implement Visual Regression Testing**
   - Select and integrate visual regression testing tool
   - Set up baseline screenshots for critical UI components
   - Integrate visual testing into CI pipeline
